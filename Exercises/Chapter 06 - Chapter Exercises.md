# Chapter 6: Loops - Practice Questions

## Example Problems with Detailed Walkthroughs

### Example 1: Understanding Range and For Loop Mechanics
**Problem:** Create a program that prints a countdown from 10 to 1, then prints "Blastoff!". Use range() with appropriate parameters to count backwards. Show the index values as you go.

**Detailed Solution:**

**Step 1: Understand what range produces**
We need to count DOWN from 10 to 1. Let's think about range parameters:
- `range(stop)` - starts at 0, goes up to (not including) stop
- `range(start, stop)` - starts at start, goes up to (not including) stop
- `range(start, stop, step)` - starts at start, goes up/down by step

**Step 2: Plan for counting backwards**
To count from 10 down to 1:
- Start: 10
- Stop: We want to include 1, so stop at 0 (remember, stop is NOT included)
- Step: -1 (negative to count down)

So: `range(10, 0, -1)` produces: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

**Step 3: Understand the for loop variable**
```python
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    # i takes on each value: 10, then 9, then 8, etc.
```

The variable `i` is just a temporary container that holds the current number from the range.

**Step 4: Verify our range**
Let's manually check:
- Start at 10: âœ“
- Next is 10 + (-1) = 9: âœ“
- Next is 9 + (-1) = 8: âœ“
- Continue until we reach 0 (not included): âœ“
- Last value printed will be 1: âœ“

**Complete Solution:**
```python
# Countdown using range with negative step
print("Countdown starting...")

for count in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(f"T-minus {count}")

print("Blastoff! ðŸš€")
```

**Output:**
```
Countdown starting...
T-minus 10
T-minus 9
T-minus 8
T-minus 7
T-minus 6
T-minus 5
T-minus 4
T-minus 3
T-minus 2
T-minus 1
Blastoff! ðŸš€
```

**Alternative with visualization:**
```python
# Show what range produces
print("Range produces:", list(range(10, 0, -1)))
print()

# Countdown
for count in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(count, end=" ")
print("\nBlastoff!")
```

**Output:**
```
Range produces: [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 
Blastoff!
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Range with negative step** counts backwards: `range(10, 0, -1)`
- **Stop value is NOT included**: range(10, 0, -1) goes down to 1, not 0
- **Loop variable changes each iteration**: `count` is 10, then 9, then 8, etc.
- **After the loop**: code after the loop runs once loop is complete
- **Default vs explicit**: `range(10)` starts at 0, `range(10, 0, -1)` is explicit

**Why this works:**
- Negative step makes range count down instead of up
- Stop at 0 ensures 1 is included (since stop is exclusive)
- The loop variable automatically takes each value from the range
- Code after the loop runs exactly once when loop finishes

### Example 2: While Loop with Input Validation and Accumulation
**Problem:** Create a program that keeps asking the user for numbers and adds them to a running total. Stop when the user enters 0. Display the count of numbers entered and the average (excluding the 0).

**Detailed Solution:**

**Step 1: Understand the requirements**
- Keep asking for numbers (unknown quantity = while loop)
- Stop when user enters 0
- Track: total sum, count of numbers
- Calculate: average = total / count

**Step 2: Recognize the while loop pattern**
We don't know how many numbers the user will enter. We need to loop "while the number is not 0":
```python
while number != 0:
    # process the number
```

**Step 3: Handle the first input**
Problem: We need a number to check before entering the loop!
```python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # Get first number
while number != 0:
    # process
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # Get next number
```

This pattern is called "read-process-read" or "priming read".

**Step 4: Track accumulation**
We need to accumulate (collect) values:
- `total` - starts at 0, add each number
- `count` - starts at 0, add 1 for each number

```python
total = 0
count = 0

while number != 0:
    total = total + number  # Accumulate sum
    count = count + 1       # Count numbers
```

**Step 5: Handle edge cases**
What if user enters 0 immediately? Count would be 0, and we'd divide by zero!
```python
if count > 0:
    average = total / count
else:
    # Handle no numbers entered
```

**Complete Solution:**
```python
# Initialize tracking variables
total = 0
count = 0

# Get first number
print("Enter numbers to sum (0 to stop)")
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Keep asking while not zero
while number != 0:
    # Add to total
    total = total + number
    
    # Increment count
    count = count + 1
    
    # Get next number
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Display results
print(f"\n=== Results ===")
print(f"Numbers entered: {count}")
print(f"Total sum: {total}")

if count > 0:
    average = total / count
    print(f"Average: {average:.2f}")
else:
    print("No numbers were entered")
```

**Sample Run:**
```
Enter numbers to sum (0 to stop)
Enter a number: 10
Enter a number: 20
Enter a number: 30
Enter a number: 0

=== Results ===
Numbers entered: 3
Total sum: 60
Average: 20.00
```

**Tracing execution:**
```
Initial: total=0, count=0
Input: 10
  Loop iteration 1: total=10, count=1
  Input: 20
  Loop iteration 2: total=30, count=2
  Input: 30
  Loop iteration 3: total=60, count=3
  Input: 0
  Loop condition (0 != 0) is False â†’ exit loop
Calculate: average = 60/3 = 20.0
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **While loop for unknown iterations**: We don't know how many numbers ahead of time
- **Priming read pattern**: Get first input before loop, get next input at end of loop
- **Accumulator pattern**: Variables that collect values (total, count)
- **Loop exit condition**: `number != 0` means loop continues while number is not 0
- **Edge case handling**: Check count > 0 before calculating average
- **The sentinel value**: 0 is our "sentinel" - special value that signals stop

**Why this works:**
- First input before loop lets us check the condition
- Input at end of loop gets next number for next condition check
- Total and count accumulate correctly because they start at 0
- Checking count prevents division by zero error

### Example 3: Break and Continue in a Menu System
**Problem:** Create a number classification program with a menu that runs until the user chooses to quit. For each number, classify it as: positive/negative/zero, even/odd (skip this for zero), and prime (skip for negative). Use break to exit and continue to skip unnecessary checks.

**Detailed Solution:**

**Step 1: Understand control flow statements**
- **break**: Exit the loop completely
- **continue**: Skip rest of current iteration, go to next iteration

**Step 2: Design the menu structure**
```python
while True:  # Infinite loop
    # Show menu
    # Get choice
    if choice == 'quit':
        break  # Exit loop
    # Process other choices
```

**Step 3: Plan the classification logic**
For each number:
1. Classify as positive/negative/zero
2. If zero â†’ skip even/odd and prime (use continue? or just structure)
3. Check even/odd
4. If negative â†’ skip prime check
5. If positive â†’ check if prime

**Step 4: Understand when to use continue**
Continue is useful when we want to skip remaining code in the loop:
```python
if number == 0:
    print("Zero")
    continue  # Skip even/odd and prime checks
# Even/odd check here (skipped if number was 0)
# Prime check here (also skipped if number was 0)
```

**Step 5: Plan prime checking**
A number is prime if it's only divisible by 1 and itself:
- 2 is prime (special case)
- Check if any number from 2 to number-1 divides evenly
- If found a divisor â†’ not prime

**Complete Solution:**
```python
print("=== Number Classifier ===")
print("Analyzes numbers for various properties")
print()

while True:
    # Show menu
    print("\n--- Menu ---")
    print("Enter a number to analyze")
    print("Type 'quit' to exit")
    
    # Get user input
    user_input = input("\nYour choice: ")
    
    # Check for quit
    if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
        print("Thank you for using Number Classifier!")
        break  # Exit the loop
    
    # Convert to number
    try:
        number = int(user_input)
    except:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a number or 'quit'")
        continue  # Skip to next iteration
    
    # Classification begins
    print(f"\n=== Analyzing {number} ===")
    
    # Step 1: Positive/Negative/Zero
    if number > 0:
        print("âœ“ Positive number")
    elif number < 0:
        print("âœ“ Negative number")
    else:
        print("âœ“ Zero (neither positive nor negative)")
        continue  # Skip even/odd and prime checks for zero
    
    # Step 2: Even/Odd (only for non-zero)
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print("âœ“ Even number")
    else:
        print("âœ“ Odd number")
    
    # Step 3: Prime check (only for positive numbers)
    if number < 0:
        print("âœ“ Prime check skipped (negative number)")
        continue  # Skip prime check
    
    # Check if prime (for positive numbers only)
    if number == 1:
        print("âœ“ Not prime (1 is not considered prime)")
    elif number == 2:
        print("âœ“ Prime number (2 is the only even prime)")
    else:
        is_prime = True
        for i in range(2, number):
            if number % i == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break  # Found a divisor, stop checking
        
        if is_prime:
            print("âœ“ Prime number")
        else:
            print("âœ“ Not prime (composite number)")
```

**Sample Run:**
```
=== Number Classifier ===
Analyzes numbers for various properties

--- Menu ---
Enter a number to analyze
Type 'quit' to exit

Your choice: 17

=== Analyzing 17 ===
âœ“ Positive number
âœ“ Odd number
âœ“ Prime number

--- Menu ---
Enter a number to analyze
Type 'quit' to exit

Your choice: 0

=== Analyzing 0 ===
âœ“ Zero (neither positive nor negative)

--- Menu ---
Enter a number to analyze
Type 'quit' to exit

Your choice: -8

=== Analyzing -8 ===
âœ“ Negative number
âœ“ Even number
âœ“ Prime check skipped (negative number)

--- Menu ---
Enter a number to analyze
Type 'quit' to exit

Your choice: quit
Thank you for using Number Classifier!
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **while True creates infinite loop**: Must have break to exit
- **break exits the loop**: Used when user types 'quit'
- **continue skips to next iteration**: Used for zero (skip even/odd/prime)
- **Nested break**: Break inside prime check loop only exits that loop
- **Try-except for error handling**: Catches invalid input
- **Logical flow with continue**: Skips unnecessary checks based on number properties

**Why this works:**
- while True ensures menu keeps running
- break provides the only exit point (quit command)
- continue lets us skip irrelevant checks efficiently
- Each continue goes back to start of while loop (menu)
- Break in prime check only exits the inner for loop

## Tips for Solving These Problems

### Understanding Range
1. **range(stop)** - Starts at 0, goes up to (not including) stop
   - `range(5)` â†’ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
2. **range(start, stop)** - Starts at start, goes up to (not including) stop
   - `range(2, 7)` â†’ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
3. **range(start, stop, step)** - Starts at start, increases by step
   - `range(0, 10, 2)` â†’ 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
   - `range(10, 0, -1)` â†’ 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

### For vs While Decision Tree
- **Known iterations**: Use for loop
  - "Print numbers 1 to 10" â†’ for loop
  - "Ask for 5 numbers" â†’ for loop
- **Unknown iterations**: Use while loop
  - "Until user enters 0" â†’ while loop
  - "Until sum exceeds 100" â†’ while loop
  - "Keep asking until valid" â†’ while loop

### Accumulator Pattern
```python
# Initialize before loop
total = 0
count = 0

# Accumulate inside loop
for i in range(10):
    total = total + i  # or total += i
    count = count + 1  # or count += 1

# Use after loop
average = total / count
```

### While Loop Patterns

**Pattern 1: Countdown**
```python
count = 10
while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count = count - 1
```

**Pattern 2: Input validation**
```python
password = ""
while password != "correct":
    password = input("Enter password: ")
```

**Pattern 3: Sum until sentinel**
```python
total = 0
number = int(input("Number (0 to stop): "))
while number != 0:
    total += number
    number = int(input("Number (0 to stop): "))
```

**Pattern 4: Infinite loop with break**
```python
while True:
    choice = input("Enter choice (q to quit): ")
    if choice == 'q':
        break
    # Process choice
```

### Break and Continue Usage

**Break - Exit loop immediately:**
```python
for i in range(100):
    if i == 50:
        break  # Stop loop at 50
    print(i)
# Prints 0 to 49
```

**Continue - Skip to next iteration:**
```python
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skip even numbers
    print(i)
# Prints 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
```

**In while loops:**
```python
while True:
    number = int(input("Enter number: "))
    if number == 0:
        break  # Exit loop
    if number < 0:
        continue  # Skip negative, ask again
    print(f"Processing {number}")
```

### Common Patterns

**Find first occurrence:**
```python
for i in range(100):
    if condition_met:
        print(f"Found at {i}")
        break
```

**Skip unwanted values:**
```python
for i in range(20):
    if should_skip:
        continue
    # Process i
```

**Validate input:**
```python
while True:
    value = int(input("Enter 1-10: "))
    if 1 <= value <= 10:
        break
    print("Invalid, try again")
```

### Problem-Solving Strategy
1. **Identify loop type**: Known iterations (for) or condition-based (while)?
2. **Determine range parameters**: Start, stop, step needed?
3. **Initialize accumulators**: What values do you need to track?
4. **Plan loop body**: What happens each iteration?
5. **Consider exit conditions**: When does the loop stop?
6. **Check edge cases**: Empty input, zero values, etc.

### Debugging Tips
1. **Print loop variable**: See what values it takes
   ```python
   for i in range(5):
       print(f"i is now: {i}")
   ```
2. **Check range output**: Use list() to see what range produces
   ```python
   print(list(range(10, 0, -1)))
   ```
3. **Trace accumulator**: Print after each update
   ```python
   total = 0
   for i in range(5):
       total += i
       print(f"After adding {i}, total is {total}")
   ```
4. **Verify conditions**: Print boolean values
   ```python
   while count < 10:
       print(f"count={count}, condition={count < 10}")
   ```
5. **Watch for infinite loops**: Ensure while condition eventually becomes False
